# Data collection tools

The rosbag tool can be used to do data collection.

- Start recording topics into a rosbag file:

    - $ rosbag record -a 
    - $ rosbag record /topic

- Rename the bag file to data.bag

- Convert data to text files easily importable in Python (modify to select the topics you want to extract):

    - $ rostopic echo -b data.bag -p /imu > imu.txt 

- Run the python file extract_data.py (modify to select the topics you want to extract)
